Introduction
  QuoteLike is an app where users can view and "like" a list of quotes.
    This list of quotes is curated by the administrators of the app.
  Users can also make suggestions for new quotes to be added. This is what is meant by a "suggestion".

  The app is completely free, with no future plans to add monetization.

  Through the app "console", an administrator may view only the data specified in the "What data is collected?" section.

  The app administrator has the ability to perform the following actions on user data:

    Resetting a user's password or disabling or deleting their account will be done only if:
      - The user has requested for this by contacting an administrator via email

        - The user is attempting some kind of attack (e.g. DDOS)
        - Etc: This is up to the administrator's discretion.

    Deleting or adding to a user's liked quotes, will only be done if:
