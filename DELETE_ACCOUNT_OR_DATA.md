# Deleting your account or data
## Deleting your account in the app
To delete your account, please:
1. Log in with that account in the quotelike app on your phone
2. Navigate to the settings page
3. Click the delete account button, and continue with through the confirmation dialog

You may be asked to sign out and back in again for security reasons at first, and have to re-attempt the deletion.

**Please note**: This does not delete any suggestions that you have made. To delete suggestions, please contact an administrator (see below).

## Requesting deletion via email
In the case where you are unable to delete your account in-app, or wish to delete suggestions that you have made, please contact an administrator (list below). 
**Make sure** that you send your account deletion request email from the email the quotelike account belongs to.

Current administrators & email addresses:
- Marco Bonato (Owner & Developer): marcobonato2007@gmail.com

## What data is removed/kept?
If you request a normal account deletion (e.g. through the app), the only remaining data kept about you will be the quote suggestions you made. These contain:
- The quote content
- The quote author
- Your user id

You can request for your suggestions to be removed (by contacting an administrator, see above section).

Please note that, after account deletion (assuming you still have suggestions), your user id (stored in each suggestion) cannot be used to identify your former email address, and the opposite is also true.
